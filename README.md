# flask

Add note, sign-up, login, logout all successful.
Failed to implement delete note, error message saying deleteNote function undefined. May be due to the sequence loading code,
such that the function has not been defined when called. The original node also failed.

Tried python 3.7,3.8 and 3.11 and all fail.
